# Security Policy

This project is created and maintained as a hobby project. It is not recommended to use if not having the latest security updates is a problem.

With that being said, it's not that this project doesn't come with the basics of security. Passwords are hashed and we don't need handle any personal information except for an (fake) email address for authentication.
